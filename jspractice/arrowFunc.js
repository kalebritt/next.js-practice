// Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the function body surrounded in { } like this:
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
    let area = width * height;
    return area;
  };
